        <h2>About My Video Series</h2>
        <p>I am making a series on binary exploitation and reverse engineering. The CPU accomplishes its tasks by doing a series of simple operations at incredible speeds. In this series, I'll take a moment to slow things down and dive deep into the inner workings of a computer's memory. We explore the basics of assembly language and the call stack, uncovering how these fundamental components drive the complex operations of your computer. Perfect for beginners interested in reverse engineering and binary exploitation, this video will give you a foundational understanding to build upon.</p>
