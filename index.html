        <p>In this video, I'll guide you through how to pass the Practical Network Penetration Tester (PNPT) exam by TCM Security, covering key aspects such as OSINT, Active Directory exploitation, A/V and egress bypassing, and network pivoting to ultimately compromise the Domain Controller. I'll also share insights on preparing a professional report and delivering a live debrief to senior penetration testers. Additionally, I'll provide a review of the exam and discuss some of the critical concepts you need to master.</p>
